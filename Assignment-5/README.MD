# COBOL VSAM KSDS Project

This project demonstrates how to create and manipulate a VSAM KSDS (Key Sequenced Data Set) using IBM Enterprise COBOL on z/OS. It includes steps for defining the VSAM dataset, compiling and linking the COBOL program, and executing the program to perform various operations on the VSAM dataset.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following steps:
1. **Step 1:** Define the VSAM KSDS Cluster.
2. **Step 2:** Compile and link the COBOL program.
3. **Step 3:** Execute the COBOL program to perform operations on the VSAM dataset (such as writing, reading, and searching for customer records).

### Steps in the JCL

1. **VSAM Cluster Definition (DEFVSAM):**
   - This step defines a VSAM KSDS dataset (`Z66845.ASS5.KSDS`), including its data and index components.

2. **COBOL Program Compilation (COBRUN):**
   - The COBOL program is compiled and linked using the IBM COBOL compiler (`IGYWCL`). The output is stored in the `Z66845.LOAD` dataset.

3. **Running the COBOL Program (RUN):**
   - This step executes the COBOL program `ASS5`, where the VSAM KSDS dataset is accessed and manipulated based on the logic in the COBOL code.

## Prerequisites

- IBM z/OS environment with access to COBOL and VSAM utilities.
- Proper dataset allocation and permissions for creating VSAM datasets.
- Knowledge of IBM JCL, COBOL, and VSAM on z/OS.

## File Structure

- **COBOL Program (`JCLASS5.cbl`)**: The COBOL source code that performs operations on the VSAM dataset.
- **JCL Script (`JCLASS5.jcl`)**: The JCL that defines the steps for defining the VSAM dataset, compiling the COBOL program, and running it.

### COBOL Program Overview (`JCLASS5.cbl`)

This program is designed to:

1. **Initialize the VSAM file** (`CUST-FILE`).
2. **Write customer records** with auto-incremented IDs.
3. **Display all customer records**.
4. **Search for a specific customer record by ID**.

The program uses the following steps:
- `INIT-PARA`: Opens the VSAM file and prepares for writing.
- `WRITE-PARA`: Writes customer records into the VSAM dataset.
- `DISPLAY-PARA`: Displays the records from the VSAM file.
- `SEARCH-PARA`: Prompts the user to enter a customer ID to search for in the dataset.

### JCL Overview (`JCLASS5.jcl`)

The JCL script defines three main steps:

1. **DEFVSAM**: Defines the VSAM dataset and its components.
2. **COBRUN**: Compiles and links the COBOL program.
3. **RUN**: Executes the COBOL program, performing operations on the VSAM dataset.

### Example Input and Output

#### Example Input for `SEARCH-PARA`:
Enter customer ID to search: 00000002
#### Example Output:
CUSTOMER RECORDS:
ID: 00000001 NAME: Customer Name 1 ADDRESS: Address 1 Street, City ID: 00000002 NAME: Customer Name 2 ADDRESS: Address 2 Street, City FOUND THE DATA SET ID: 00000002 NAME: Customer Name 2 ADDRESS: Address 2 Street, City

## How to Run

### Step 1: Define the VSAM KSDS

Run the `DEFVSAM` step to create the VSAM dataset. Ensure the `Z66845.ASS5.KSDS` dataset is successfully created.

### Step 2: Compile the COBOL Program

Execute the `COBRUN` step to compile and link the COBOL program.

### Step 3: Run the COBOL Program

Execute the `RUN` step to perform the operations defined in the COBOL program.

## Troubleshooting

- **JCL Error Codes:**
   - If you encounter an error in the JCL, check the return codes (MAXCC) from each step.
   - The VSAM dataset may not be created if the `DEFVSAM` step fails. Ensure the cluster is defined correctly.

- **Dataset Issues:**
   - If the dataset `Z66845.ASS5.KSDS` already exists, you may need to delete it before running the `DEFVSAM` step.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to work with VSAM KSDS datasets in a COBOL program on z/OS. You can use this project as a reference for defining, manipulating, and managing VSAM datasets in real-world applications.
